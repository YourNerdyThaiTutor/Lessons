											<h1>Spotify</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>I'm a Zillennial, so this is my Thai playlist that we listen to everyday. It's a lot of songs from the early 2000s, some 70s, some 80s, some 90s. Some are new songs.</h3>

											<h1>Shows, Movies</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<p>Most movies made by GTH, I guess they call it GDH now, are good. K-drama remakes, True makes good ones. My grandma loves soaps on channel 3. They call it after news drama. I don't know if they still do this, but back in the days channel 7 have soaps with the most low budget props and wildest writing. It seems like they're just winging it every week. It's not well made, but definitely funny on how low budget it is.</p>

											<h1>Good Cheap food</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<p>Michelin stars may sound enticing, but those are expensive. You know what place has the best cheap food? Right in front of schools. Go follow those kids and see what they are eating, just don't be creepy.</p>

                                        <article>
											<h1>Fish sauce</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<p>My true love, every year I wait to be reunited with my dearest condiment. My favorite brand of all time is Pornpimol (พรพิมล).  Maybe I should gatekeep this, but if they get more popular maybe they'll export to America so I don't have to carry 24 bottles across the ocean every time.</p>

											<h1>Road Trips</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<p>Backpacking and going on trains or flying is fun and all, but my parents love road trips. Sometimes, it's not even about the destinations, it's about the gas stations and go to local giftshops get their famous local souvenirs. Maybe I'll put a list of things to get in each province and what they are known for later. Just know that if you see OTOP signs, those are products crafted to represent their areas. OTOP stands for One Tambon One Product. Tambon is a sub-district, and each one of them have a product that the whole Tambon selects to represent themselves as what they are known for. </p>

											<h1>Booking Hotels</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<p>It's somehow cheaper to book through a third party most of the times. Agoda is what my dad usually uses. The hotels seem to not have problems with it unlike here in the States where it's such a headache to book through a third party.</p>

                                        <article>
											<h1>Taking buses</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<p>Some older buses don't have screens or even if they do and you have no idea when to get off. What I always do is sit next to the ticket person or the driver and ask them to let you know when the stop is. These people are usually very nice and helpful. If they sound mean, find an aunty or uncle who seems like this is their regular commute and do the same thing: attach like a baby koala. Don't actually touch them though. Attach---emotionally? that still sounds wrong. You know what I mean. Thai people are always ready to adopt a lost child. I'm always a lost child. I'm a third child, my parents forget I exist in public a lot.</p>

											<h1>Thai people leaving stuff out in public</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<p>You might think oh Thailand is so safe, people leave their stuff out in public. Nope, they saw you, they remember what you look like. Thai people have good memory, just look at our writing system it's so complicated and we all can do it. They remember your face, so if their stuff is gone, first thing they are going to do is think that you took it. Thai people are gossipy, they will shit talk anyone so hard they cry out blood if they see someone take things, might even see Muay Thai in action. Bullying is our social safety net. Therefore, to not be a criminal in anyone's mind and might end up getting arrested, watch people's stuff when they leave. It is implied.</p>

											<h1>Getting Good reccommendations</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<p>Learn Thai until you are fluent and speak like a local, then you'll get better reccommendations, not just tourist traps. Search for things in Thai and there will be more options, because a lot of local business are marketing towards local. Do your lessons regularly. What I like to do when exploring new parts of Thailand is asking the Grab driver what the good restaurants are in the area. Even if they get commission, the commissions are usually free food there, so it means that the food is good that they want to go back and have some too. </p>  
                                                <p>If you're not fluent yet, go to the park. Join a Tai Chi group or aerobics group. There will always be some buff aunties or uncles working out, enjoying their retirement. Those are the nicest old people you'll ever meet. They might look intimidating but buff old people are always happy. Chances are one of them know English and want to practice.</p>
