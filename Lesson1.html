											<p>An expression to help Thais memorize their middle toned consonants</p>
										</header>
										<p>Thai is a tonal language as many have been told. Not only there are intonations, the consonants themselves have tones to them. The middle toned consonants are the easiest to learn, because they have stright forward rules with their tones that we'll get into in Lesson 3. 
                                        
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            As you'll see when we get into the alphabet, Thai letters do come with a word that the letter stands for. It is like when people use A. for Alpha, B for Bravo, and so on. It is what people use to help them spell, because there are many letters that have the same sound. Therefore, when you are spelling something, you will need to know the names of the letter in order to have Thai people help you spell something correctly. By learning the names of all 44 consonants, you'll already learn 44 words.
                                        </p>
