											<p>An expression to help Thais memorize their low toned single consonants</p>
										</header>
										<p>We've already discussed mid toned. Now we're at low toned. They start off at neutral tone when you don't put any tone marks on them, and they cannot reach the highest tone by themselves. Low toned consonants need help by either adding "ห" or pairing with a high consonant to get all of the tones unlike mid toned consonants that can cover every tone by themselves. The reason why this category is single is that these letters do not need to be paired with high consonants to complete all 5 tones, they just need to add "ห" in front to expand their tones.
                                        
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        the table below will show you how single low toned consonants compare to the mid toned consonants
                                        </p>

                                       As you can see the tones are still the same vocally but in written form, they just have different formats. On the second tone there are 2 options to write the same sounds that are pronounced exactly the same way. They just have different meanings. น่า means ____able or making you want to do something for example. น่ารัก: รัก means love, so น่ารัก is lovable or cute. น่ากิน : กิน means eat, so น่ากิน means appetizing, something that looks delicious that you want to eat right now (nom nom nom). On the other hand, หน้า means face, topping, or in front of. It can mean a person's face as in the part of their body, toppings as in when you order a pizza and you need to put toppings on, or in front of something or somewhere. For example, you can say หน้าบ้าน= in front of the house หน้าวัด=in front of the temple

										<article>
											<h1>งู (snake) ง.งู</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>ง.งู is probably the most difficult sound to make for an English speaker. งู means snake. It makes a "NG" sound like in English, as in "song", "wing", "pingpong", etc. However, it's not only an ending sound. Thai words do start with ng so try to take the ng sound from these English words and put it in front of a word. </h3>

										<article>
											<h1>ใหญ่(big) ญ.หญิง</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>หญิง means female, as in women, girls. The word ใหญ่ in the phrase means big. In the phrase it is put with งู , so together it makes big snake. It makes a "Y" sound like in English, as in "yellow", "yell", "yes", etc. </h3>

											<h1>นอน(sleep) น.หนู</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>หนู means a mouse or rat. The word นอน in the phrase means to sleep. The big snake sleeps. It makes a "N" sound like in English, as in "new", "nest", "never", etc. </h3>

											<h1>อยู่(ing v./ is at) ย.ยักษ์</h1>
											<div class="content">
												<h3>ยักษ์ means a giant, as in the monster. The word อยู่ in the phrase can make a verb into an -ing verb as in someone is currently doing something, so the big snake is sleeping. You might notice that instead of the "ห" that we add in front to get to the tone we see "อ" instead. There are 4 words with this exception, don't worry about it now. We'll get to that later. It makes a "Y" sound like in English. It is the same sound like "ญ" but "ย" is more common, so I'd study this one more. </h3>

The word ณ in the phrase means to be at a place. The big snake is sleeping at...somewhere. It makes a "N" sound like "น", but is not as common as "น". </h3>

												<h3>เรือ means boat, ship, as in the vehicle that floats on water. The word ริม in the phrase means the edge, border, rim (hehe it's the same word in English). It makes a "R" sound like in English, as in "rim", "rose", "rat", etc. Thai peoplle are lazy. We don't like to roll our "R" so most of the time you'll hear "L" instead.</h3>
